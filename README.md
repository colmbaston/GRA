# 3D Graphics Project

This is a 3D OpenGL scene, featuring a volcano in the centre of a lake of lava, with bats flying overhead. It is written using GLUT in C++, originally for a 3D graphics module as part of my undergraduate degree.

## Controls

* W, A, S, D, Q, and E to move forward, left, backward, right, up, and down respectively.
* Click and drag to change camera angle.
* C to toggle between perspective and orthographic projection.
* P to pause the simulation.
* V to cause the volcano to erupt.
